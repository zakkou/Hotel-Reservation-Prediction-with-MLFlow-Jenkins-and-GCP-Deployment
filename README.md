End-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting hotel reservation cancellations. Features experiment tracking with MLFlow, automated CI/CD with Jenkins, and production deployment on Google Cloud Platform.

##  Project Overview

Predicts likelihood of hotel booking cancellations using historical reservation data. Key components:
- **MLFlow**: Experiment tracking, model registry & artifact storage
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing & deployment
- **GCP**: Cloud Run for model serving + Cloud Storage for artifacts
- **Scikit-Learn/XGBoost**: Machine learning model training


##  Key Features
- **Automated ML Pipeline**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Model training with multiple algorithms
  - Performance evaluation and model selection
- **MLFlow Integration**:
  - Experiment tracking with parameters/metrics
  - Model versioning and registry
  - Artifact logging (plots, preprocessors)
- **Jenkins CI/CD**:
  - Automated testing on code commits
  - Model retraining pipeline triggers
  - Deployment to staging/production
- **GCP Deployment**:
  - Docker container deployment via Cloud Run
  - REST API for real-time predictions
  - Google Cloud Storage for model artifacts
